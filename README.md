Description : 
This project is a 3d Plaformer, mario like, made on Unreal Engine 5. The main goal of the project was to learn Unreal Engine 5.

Features : 

- A player which can move with WASD, can sprint with CTRL and can jump with SPACE
- 2 types of enemies wich will follow you if they see you. If you collide with them you take 1 damage. If you jump on their head you can kill them for the first type of enemy and for the other you will make one damage to them, then they will go to their spawnpoint to regains 1 HP after 5s
- There are many traps such as : lava that bounce you and inflict you one HP, spikes that damage you too or a killzone that teleport you to your last spawnpoint and inflict one HP.
- You can also see different props on the level like a bumper to bounce you to the sky, an Heart to restore your life and a pipe that let you go into it to teleport to an other pipe (like in Mario), if you press E at the top of the pipe.
